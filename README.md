# Developing data products, week 4 assignment

# Over view:

This Rmarkdown presentation is about Iris dataset from the datasets package. Here I used Shiny application to check the iris data attribute measurements with the help of histogram.
 
  In Shiny application the file ui.R gives the information about slider bar and option to choose the attribute, where as the server.R gives the information to build the histogram for the iris attribute.
 
 The iris dataset contains 50 samples of 3 different species of iris.

## Attribute information

### Iris attributes in centimeters:
1. sepal length
2. sepal width
3. petal length
4. petal width

### classes:
1. Iris Satosa
2. Iris Versicolour
3. Iris Virginica
   
## The reproducible pitch presentation is available in the following link:

In this link, by  opting the iris attribute and with the help of slider bar we can know the measurement of the iris attributes. 
Also this gives the histogram of sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.
